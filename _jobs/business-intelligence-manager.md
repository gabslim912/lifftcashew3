Shelter For Life International (SFL) is an international faith-based relief and development organization with over 30 years experience in providing sustainable development and humanitarian assistance to post conflict countries around the world. We are currently operational in Afghanistan, Liberia, and Senegal, with Headquarters located in Minnetonka, MN. Our mission is to Demonstrate God’s love by enabling people affected by conflict and disaster to restore their lives and rebuild their communities.

Background: 

Under USDA/FAS Food For Progress (FFPr), SFL is implementing a six year program in Senegal, The Gambia, and GuineaBissau with a goal to develop and upgrade value chain linkages necessary to support an integrated regional trade network for the cashew value chain. The “Linking Infrastructure, Finance, and Farms To Cashew” (LIFFT-Cashew) program is working to create durable trade infrastructure, increase access to financial services, organize and train smallholder farmers to increase production and bargaining power, and build the capacity of local processors to add value to kernels in the cashew production zone of West Africa. As a result, the program will benefit smallholder farmers, a range of processors, and a variety of other businesses associated with the cashew value chain. 

LIFFT-Up is a Salesforce-based platform designed for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and program partners to collect, analyze, and disseminate market micro-data. The purpose of the system is to have a single data platform with detailed information about value chain actors which can paint a broad picture of market statistics to support trade of agricultural products. It is supported by Einstein Analytics, a powerful tool which uses AI learning to analyze data and create reports. Einstein Analytics allows us to analyze collected market data within Salesforce and create tailored market reports. Using TaroWorks, SFL’s field agents in the SeGaBi region collect and validate information offline, and this information is then synced to the LIFFT-Up platform at the end of each day, or when internet access is available.
