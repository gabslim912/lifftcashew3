“After a record RCN production of 315,000 tons in 2017/18, Tanzania produced 250,000 tons in 2018/19. The drop-in production is mainly due to bad weather in 2018. Tanzania is set to increase production to more than 350,000 tons in 2019/2020. In each year, the government is planning to plant more than 10,000,000 new cashewnut trees. Cashew nuts sub sector is one among the main contributors in export earnings, ranked the first among the export crops from Tanzania. That contribution is mainly from exports of RCN. The contribution will be higher in the course of expanding interests in establishing local processing facilities, which will bring paradigm shift in terms of food quality, safety and hygiene, as well as market orientations. Currently, less than 20% of raw cashewnuts are processed locally and very little value addition in cashew and by-products are done within the country. The government is continuously providing more incentives to investors who have shown interest in establishing factories in agro processing with particular emphasis to cashewnut sub sector from which already the country is losing a lot of economic gains by exporting raw cashewnuts to the world markets. The Government of Tanzania invites all interested companies and individuals wishing to invest in Tanzania to utilize this noble opportunity which aims at benefiting all parties on win-win bases.”
