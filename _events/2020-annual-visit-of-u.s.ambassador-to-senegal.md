A lengthy low-level conflict in the Casamance region of southern Senegal disrupted local communities and displaced thousands of local people. In recent years peace has returned, and so have many former residents of the area. As many of these peoples’ former homes were destroyed, there was a urgent need for shelter.

To address this need, SFL launched the Returnee Reintegration Program funded by the US State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM). The program assists returnee families to return home by overseeing the construction of transitional shelters and the supply of clean water. In the first phase of funding, SFL assisted 250 families. This year, with renewed funding, our team is engaged in building 257 additional shelters and several community wells.

Last month, our team along with community members who have received of new homes through the program were honored to host the US Ambassador to Senegal, Tulinabo Mushingi, at a program building site. Throughout the afternoon there was a symbolic brick-laying ceremony at a new SFL-built house, an address by the ambassador to the local community, site visits to check on the building progress of some of the new homes, and visits with a few local program participants.

SFL is pleased to partner with PRM to help meet the needs of southern Senegal returnee communities and look forward to a year well spent building even more shelters!
