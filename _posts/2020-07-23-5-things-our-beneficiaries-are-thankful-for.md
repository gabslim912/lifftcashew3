Feeling thankful? So are we! In the spirit of thanksgiving, we thought we would share 5 things our beneficiaries are thankful for:

**1. Water.** Water is the driving force of all nature. The inconsistency of rainfall and severe droughts in northern Afghanistan make it very difficult for families to cultivate their crops. Abdul is just one of many farmers who has seen massive improvements in his land since we constructed reservoirs in his area:

> “My yearly yield, compare to previous year, has increased by four times! Now in each season we have fruit and vegetable, which we not only use at home but we also sell to the market. I’m thankful for the Americans who came here and built this water pool for us so now I can water my plants, without having to worry about the rain.”

**2. Micro-Loans.** Being able to thrive, instead of just survive, is an opportunity not all of us receive. Women in our Sustainable Livelihoods and Agriculture Enterprise Development (SLAED) program, like Pari, know firsthand how big of am impact a small loan can have:

> “Before SFL staff came here, our village was forgotten and no one was thinking about us and our problems. Even the government did not listen to us. Since SFL came many things have changed in our village. I feel happier than before and I am able to purchase household items with eggs I sell.”

**3. Roads.** We all love a quick commute! In many parts of West Africa, roads are narrow, damaged, and often unsafe, making it difficult for farmers to reach their fields. Bala, a farmer along one of the numerous roads we have constructed in Senegal, says he is thankful that the new roads make it easier for people to get to their fields:

> “In the past, it could take as long as three to five hours to get from here to Bafata, but now it’s a journey of ten minutes. There is no greater peace than being able to reach your field, fetch your cashews or mangoes, when you couldn’t do that in the past.”

**4. Knowledge Sharing.** Is there anything better than learning something new? Agricultural training is known as one of the best ways to bring economic benefit to a community. Helal, a farmer in northern Afghanistan, is thankful for the knowledge our team has passed onto him:

> “Due to new methods we have learned, we were able to plant a second crop of vegetables for family consumption and fodder crops for animal husbandry. We now have double crops on one jerib of our land and the results have been very good, we are very happy!”

**5. Peace and Safety.** There is nothing quite like feeling safe and connected in your own community. For years, Diara’s community was fragmented and fearful. Since our team rebuilt roads in the area, a sense of safety has returned to the community and Diara has been able to build connections with neighboring villages.

> “Before the road was built, no one stayed out in the evening. No one traveled on the old road, and before this one was built I didn’t know anyone in other villages. Now, we have links with everyone in the other villages and I have more opportunities to sell my produce and get better prices!”

**BONUS: 6. You!**

On behalf of all our beneficiaries and the staff at SFL, we want to say a huge THANK YOU for your ongoing support. Thanks to you, we have been able to make some incredible impacts in the lives of those around the world.
